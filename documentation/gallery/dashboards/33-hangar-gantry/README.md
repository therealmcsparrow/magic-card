# Hangar gantry

The home, run from a working spacecraft hangar. An armoured bay door fills the left and centre of the wall, with its data bays recessed into the two leaves. A service column stands on the right, and the controls sit on a yellow pendant box hanging from a chain beside the door.

The door shows the state of the house. Three locking bars slide across the seam: they sit shut while the alarm is armed and slide clear when it is disarmed. The trolley on the gantry travels along the beam with house power, from 0 kW on the left to 5 kW over the door edge.

In an alarm the amber work lights turn red, two beacons on the door and one on the column sweep the steel, the bars slam shut and rattle in their sleeves, and every bay title goes red.
